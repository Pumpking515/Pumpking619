Landing
Note: these are my personal tips and not necessarily procedures.
Bring thrust levers back to idle at about 20' in normal conditions. In gusty
condition you may want to carry thrust longer. In gusty conditions I use 1o' to go
to idle. The aircraft has plenty of airspeed and energy with managed speed being
flown and you will not need to delay thrust reduction to ensure proper flare in
normal conditions. Don't let nose drop when normal nose down pitch is added at
50' in flare mode. I was used to flying smaller (and shorter geared!) jets and
found it helpful to move my aim point on the runway from the 1000' marker to
halfway between the 1000' and 1500'. Try to have the flare started by the 10' call.
Do not carry thrust to the flare as the autothrust will begin to command climb
thrust as speed deteriorates if you do not bring back idle. This will cause a “thrust
bump"” that will have you floating down the runway with excess energy.
On touch down use positive nose down to lower the nose. Be careful not to let
the nose ride up when reverse is selected. Select Full Reverse as you lower
nose. As the aircraft slows through 80 knots slowly push the thrust levers back
toward idle reverse so as to be at or near idle reverse at 6o knots. Be sure you
push the thrust lever all the way back through the detent into forward idle. Then
retard the lever again against the stop to ensure minimum forward thrust in idle.
