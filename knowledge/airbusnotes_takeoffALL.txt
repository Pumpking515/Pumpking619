Two takeoff profiles.Note:Rolling takeoffs are normal,expected and will meet all
performance requirements.
Crew will use the Normal Takeoff Profile (NADP 2)except when specifically
required to use the Noise Abatement Profile (NADP 1).
NADP 2 will indicate LVR CLB(set thrust levers to CLB)at 1000 feet AFL and
will adjust pitch to accelerate to 250 or as set.
NADP 1 will indicate LVR CLB (set thrust levers to CLB)at 1500 feet AFL but will
maintain pitch to hold V2+10 until 3000 feet AFL,then it will lower pitch to
accelerate to 250 or as set.
Make your flight instructor happy!:When setting power for takeoff,the thrust
levers should be set to 50%N1(CFM)or 1.05 EPR(IAE)on the TLA(doughnut)
and once both engines stabilize then position both levers to FLEX or TOGA.
Make an initial setting on the thrust levers and then adjust on the TLA to 50%or
1.05 EPR.Set takeoff thrust by 40 kts.(OM 2d.1.2)
Make your flight instructor happy!:If not a rolling takeoff release the brakes
once the initial 50%or 1.05 EPR is set.If you go to full takeoff power before
releasing the brakes it will be a rather abrupt jolt that you and your passengers
won't like!This is a jet not a little prop plane!
Note:Allow at least 5 minutes for engine warm up before applying takeoff thrust
for first flight of day.After first flight of day use a minimum of 3 mins.warm up if
engine is shut down 1 hrs.or less.
Do not use aileron into the wind during a crosswind (AOM I 6.1.1).During a
takeoff with crosswind component exceeding 20 kts.or tailwind apply full forward
sidestick to be taken out by 80 to 100 kts.During all normal takeoffs use half
forward sidestick pressure until 80 to 100 kts.Ensure the aileron is neutralized by
looking at the "control pointer cross"on the PFD or relax the sidestick to center
during the takeoff roll.This will ensure that you do not have any roll in the initial
rotation and liftoff.During crosswind takeoff let engines stabilize at(CFM)50%
then increase to 70%N1 and above 15 kts ground speed increase to FLEX or
TOGA by 40 kts.ground speed or(IAE)1.05 EPR and stabilize,then increase to
FLEX or TOGA by 40 kts.ground speed.Slowly release any rudder being held
during crosswind takeoff during the rotation.By liftoff you should have rudder
neutral during a crosswind takeoff.
Airbus Gotcha:If on taxi out you do not have the V speeds showing in your
PFD (after entry in MCDU),make sure that your Flight Director is turned on.
Note:If no FLEX temp is set(TOGA)and thrust levers are set to FLEX on takeoff
the thrust will go to TOGA at 80 kts.This is to avoid an underperformance
takeoff.
On takeoff,PF should have the PERF-TAKEOFF page,PM the F-PLN page
Use a radar tilt of 5-8 UP if radar required during takeoff.
When required set a departure heading for selection at 400'.Note:set the
heading you will need at 400'.If you are using a SID departure where NAV is
required NAV mode will engage at 30'automatically,do not set a heading for
NAV departure.
Use ARC or ROSE NAV on takeoff on your EFIS ND settings.Do not fly around
in PLAN.Only use PLAN as a momentary reference in-flight.
Captain makes all takeoffs when visibility is less than either 1600 RVR or mile
visibility if no RVR reported.
On takeoff the aircraft will "blend"from direct to normal law as it goes from
ground mode to flight mode.This means that the backpressure that you need to
hold the nose up will reduce to zero once normal law autotrim activates.You will
usually not really notice this change as the aircraft will be climbing quickly but
you will learn to release the backpressure around 100 to 200 ft.as the trim kicks
in or the nose will "balloon".A good Airbus pilot quickly learns to minimize input
as many times the pilot is inducing a slight amount of sidestick pressure without
realizing it.Remember,the less input on the stick the better.You don't want to
'confuse"the computers (or the pilot!).
New Airbus pilots tend to get into the habit of "slapping"the Thrust Levers back
from TOGA or FLX/MCT to the CL detent.This isn't the best technique and can
be very noticeable in back to the passengers and harder on the engines when
using TOGA or minimal FLEX reductions.When the FLEX temp is around 60
there will be little or no power reduction when coming out of FLX/MCT to CL and
this is why pilots get used to just "slapping"the levers back.At TOGA or less
FLEX the immediate reduction is very noticeable.Ease the thrust levers back
from FLX/MCT or TOGA to the CL detent slowly just as you would on any other
aircraft.Your passengers and engines will appreciate it!
RTO-Rejected Takeoff(AOM 6.4)
ECAM will inhibit all warnings/cautions that are not paramount from 80 kts.to
1500'AGL.All rejects done by captain.
>
The captain calls "Reject,My Aircraft"
F/O calls "Your Aircraft"(if control transferred)
Thrust Levers idle (when the thrust levers go to idle the ground spoilers
extend,which then trigger the autobrakes,ensure maximum braking)
>
Select Full Reverse
>F/O call(f applicable)“Single Reverse”or“No Reverse”
F/O monitor autobrakes,call "Autobrakes OFF"if they do not engage or
when they are disengaged
>
F/O notify tower
>F/O call“80
>F/O call“60”
Maintain slight forward pressure on sidestick
>Stop aircraft
If evacuation NOT IMMEDIATELY required -Capt.inform passengers
and flight attendants "This is the captain,remain seated",etc.
>
If evacuation IMMEDIATELY required Call for QRH Evacuation
procedure.
After Reject consider:
>Aircraft condition
Clear the runway if helpful (if autobrakes MAX used,release brakes by
disarming spoilers)
Passenger evacuation or not
Hot Brakes-(OM 6.4.6)AML entry and maintenance action is required if:
>150C difference in brake temps on the same strut and one brake 600 or
greater or60°or less
a mean 200C difference between different trucks
fuse plug melted
>brake temp exceeds900°C(800°-A321)
Note:If necessary,maximum reverse may be used until aircraft comes to
complete stop.Also,if aircraft comes to full stop with Autobrakes you must
disarm the spoilers to taxi.
Note:Autobrakes will not activate below 72 kts.
Max Rate of Climb:(AOM 7.3.4)
A319:260KIAS/.76M
A320:260KIAS/.76M
A321:280KIAS/.76M
Max Climb Angle:Slow to Green Dot Speed with OP CLB.EXPED climb pb will
give maximum climb angle by applying maximum climb thrust and controlling
speed to down to green dot.Note:EXPED pb can produce a rapid change and is
not intended for routine use.Use above FL 250 should be avoided.
V1 Cuts (AOM 6.5)
Pick a line and stick to it no matter what on every takeoff.You will find that you
will just naturally put in the correct rudder for V1 cuts if you practice this on every
takeoff.You don't have to hit the centerline lights but stay right on the centerline.
You should have the aircraft already stabilized with rudder before rotation
(assuming the cut is before the Rotate call).Bring the nose up to 12.5(park it on
the 12.5"shelf")and hold it.Then follow the flight director.The only real Gotcha
here is that the aircraft takes off in Direct mode.It will then blend to Normal.This
means that you will have autotrim kicking in just after takeoff.Remember in direct
you will be holding back pressure to keep the nose at 12.5 until Normal law with
autotrim comes in and then you will need to release the back pressure on the
sidestick.In fact this is what happens on every takeoff.Be sure that you don't try
to trim off the rudder so quickly that you are diverted from flying during the blend
from direct to normal as the trim coming in will cause you to pitch up if you aren't
watching for it.Since technically the autopilot can be put on at 100'some folks try
to show how good they are and start trimming rudder right away.Better to wait
until the blend is complete around a few hundred feet first and then trim the
rudder and then get it on autopilot.You don't get any bonus points for a quick
rudder trim while losing speed and pitch control!
Note:If taking off in FLEX the PF has the discretion to leave thrust levers in
FLEX or to increase to TOGA.If aircraft is heavy,runway is short,aircraft must
be maneuvered for obstacle clearance,aircraft is on fire or has other time critical
problem pilot should consider using TOGA if not already selected.Thrust should
be increased to TOGA in a slow,deliberate manner in order to not destabilize the
situation.You may do this while on the runway.If airborne it is best to do this
once on autopilot.If increasing to TOGA while airborne do it while on autopilot
and below 1000 ft and still climbing.Once level you should only reduce from
FLEX to CL and then back to MCT.
Note:If thrust levers are left in FLEX during engine out takeoff then they must be
positioned to CLB or TOGA and reset back to MCT(same detent as FLEX)when
engine out procedures call for reduction to MCT.This is due to the fact that the
same detent is used for FLEX and MCT.By selecting from FLEX to CL or TOGA
and then back to the MCT detent the logic is satisfied for the FMGC.
